# AFontaine-Portfolio

## Hello, and thank you for taking a look at my Portfolio README! Although there may not be much to see here yet, this is the beginning of my professional coding portfolio. I have added user-friendly links to both content within the page itself, as well as buttons to bring you to my launched projects so far. As a potential future employer, it is my hope that you look at this page and see potential for the great things I am hoping to become capable of after completion of the coding bootcamp in which I am currently enrolled, as well as recognizing that I am so excited to learn more and receive critique for my work.

### Thank you for [visiting my page](https://adifontaine.github.io/AFontaine-Portfolio/)
